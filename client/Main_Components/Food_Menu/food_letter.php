                    <p>Dear Customers</p>
                    <p>Thank you very much for your ongoing support. We truly appreciate it.</p>
                    <p>It is with sincere regret that we must inform you of an impending adjustment to our menu prices, effective from Monday, February 12th.</p>
                    <p>The business circumstances since last year have necessitated this change, as we are unable to avoid the impact of rising operational costs.</p>
                    <p>However, please rest assured that our commitment to providing you with quality dishes remains unchanged.</p>
                    <p>Thank you once again for your understanding and continued support.</p>
                    <p class="date">February 2024</p>
